## Vision Statement for the "Aider Small Tweak Integration" Step

This development phase aims to *prove the core concept* of automated code modification within the Sleepy AI Army context by integrating the `aider` tool to *reliably execute* predefined `"Small Tweak"` tasks. The focus is on successfully parsing simple, single-file change requests, programmatically constructing and executing the correct `aider` command, and capturing the outcome, thereby *validating the fundamental mechanism* for AI-driven coding assistance and laying the groundwork for more complex agent capabilities.

**Key Points of this Specific Vision:**

* **Goal:** Prove automated code modification using `aider`.
* **Scope:** Limited to `"Small Tweaks"` (minor, single-file, predefined changes).
* **Mechanism:** Programmatic command generation, execution (`subprocess`), and result capture.
* **Purpose:** Validate the basic `aider` integration before tackling more complex planning or multi-step tasks.
