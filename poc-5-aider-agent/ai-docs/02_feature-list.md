## Revised High-Level MVP Feature List (Strictly WHAT):

* **Task Deconstructor:** Capability to process a simple task description (e.g., "Add documentation to `main.py`") to identify the target filename (`main.py`) and the requested change ("Add documentation").
* **File Locator:** Capability to determine the correct, full path to the target file within the specified project workspace, using the filename identified from the task description.
* **`aider` Command Formatter:** Capability to assemble the specific arguments needed to instruct the `aider` tool, using the located file path and the requested change.
* **`aider` Command Execution:** Capability to initiate the `aider` tool with the assembled arguments, operating within the context of the specified project workspace.
* **Execution Result Reporting:** Capability to capture the outcome of the `aider` execution (e.g., success or failure status, relevant messages) and make it available to the process that initiated the execution.
* **Workspace Context Configuration:** Capability to define or identify the root directory of the target software project where file locating and `aider` execution should take place.
