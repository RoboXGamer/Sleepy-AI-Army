# Change Notes: Sleepy Dev Team - PoC 3 (Context & Q&A)

## v01

**Description:** Initial implementation of the agent framework structure based on the technical architecture and PRD for PoC 3.

**Details:**
*   Created the base directory structure (`src/sleepy-ai-army/sleepy_ai_army/`, `shared_libraries/`, `shared_tools/`, `sub_agents/`, `tests/`).
*   Added required `__init__.py` files for Python packages.
*   Created `.env` file for environment variables.
*   Implemented `shared_libraries/constants.py` with file names and status strings.
*   Updated `shared_tools/file_system.py` to include `read_file`, `append_file`, and `list_directory` functions.
*   Updated `shared_tools/__init__.py` to export the new file system tools.
*   Created the root `TaskPlannerAgent` (`agent.py`, `prompt.py`) responsible for status checking and routing.
*   Created the `ContextResearchAgent` (`sub_agents/context_research/agent.py`, `sub_agents/context_research/prompt.py`) for initial context gathering.
*   Created the `QnAAgent` (`sub_agents/questions_and_answers/agent.py`, `sub_agents/questions_and_answers/prompt.py`) for iterative Q&A.
*   Created the `ChangelogAgent` (`sub_agents/changelog/agent.py`, `sub_agents/changelog/prompt.py`) designed to be used as a tool for appending log entries.
*   Updated relevant `__init__.py` files to export the defined agents.
