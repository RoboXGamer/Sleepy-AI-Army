## Final Implementation MVP Features (Tasks for AI Coder):

1.  **Implement Test Execution Structure:** Code the necessary agents: a `Root Agent` managing a `SequentialAgent`. The `SequentialAgent` will contain four distinct sub-agents:
    * **Step A:** Designed to reliably simulate a specific failure condition (e.g., return a structured error).
    * **Step B:** A placeholder agent whose primary function is to perform a simple, observable task (e.g., log `"Agent B running: Cheeky response!"`). Crucially, this step also incorporates the outcome-checking logic (defined in Feature #2) that runs *before* its simple task.
    * **Step C:** Another placeholder agent performing its own distinct, simple, observable task (e.g., log `"Agent C running: Another message."`).
    * **Step D:** The designated final reporting/completion step.
2.  **Implement Controllable Failure in Step A:** Code the logic within the Step A sub-agent to allow triggering the specific failure condition needed for the test.
3.  **Implement Failure Check Mechanism Before Step B Task:** Code the designated outcome-checking logic (e.g., using a `before_agent_callback` or similar mechanism associated with Step B) designed to inspect the result of Step A and influence whether Step B proceeds to execute its simple task.

## Verification Steps (Manual Check using Built-in ADK Observability):

Once the features above are implemented, the experiment's success will be verified manually by:

1. Running the `Root Agent`, ensuring the failure condition in Step A is triggered.
2. Inspecting the standard `ADK` logging or state tracking outputs to determine:
    * Did Step B execute its simple task (i.e., was its distinct message logged) or was it skipped (either by the sequence handler directly or by the logic implemented in Feature #3)?
    * Did Step C execute its simple task (i.e., was its distinct message logged) or was it skipped?
    * Did Step D execute successfully?
    * Did control return correctly from the `SequentialAgent` back to the `Root Agent` upon completion?
