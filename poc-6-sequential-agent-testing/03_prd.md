# Product Requirements Document: PoC 6 (ADK SequentialAgent Failure Handling Experiment)

**Version:** 1.0-PoC6
**Date:** 2025-05-05

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Level 1 requirements for Proof-of-Concept 6 (PoC 6). This PoC is a technical experiment designed to validate and demonstrate a specific control flow pattern within the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), specifically using the `SequentialAgent`. The experiment aims to clarify how intermediate steps within a sequence can be conditionally skipped based on the failure of a preceding step, while still ensuring that a designated final step is always executed reliably. This document defines the required setup, procedure, and observable outcomes for the experiment.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

* **Goal:** Experimentally validate a mechanism using standard ADK features to achieve conditional skipping of intermediate steps following a failure, combined with guaranteed execution of a final step within a `SequentialAgent`.
* **Objective:** Implement a specific four-step agent sequence (A, B, C, D) within an ADK `SequentialAgent`.
* **Objective:** Implement a controllable failure simulation within Step A (via a tool call returning an error).
* **Objective:** Implement conditional logic preceding Step B (checking Step A's outcome) and Step C (checking Step B's outcome) to prevent their main tasks from executing if the respective preceding step failed.
* **Objective:** Ensure Step D always executes its main task, regardless of earlier failures.
* **Objective:** Implement Step D to generate and record a summary of the sequence execution outcome.
* **Objective:** Ensure control explicitly returns from the `SequentialAgent` to its parent `Root Agent` after Step D completes.

## 3. Target Audience / User Personas

* **Primary User:** The developer conducting the experiment, responsible for triggering the execution and manually verifying the outcome by observing the standard logs and state tracking provided by the `adk web` interface.

## 4. Experimental Setup & Procedure

This section describes the required configuration and the expected observable behavior when the experiment is run under the failure condition.

### 4.1. Required Setup

* A `Root Agent` must be implemented.
* The `Root Agent` must invoke an instance of ADK's `SequentialAgent`.
* The `SequentialAgent` must contain exactly four sub-agents executed in the order A, B, C, D.
    * **Agent A:** Designed to perform a simple task that includes making a tool call. This tool call must be configured to reliably return a structured error, thus simulating the failure condition for the experiment. Agent A should record its outcome (i.e., failure).
    * **Agent B:** Designed with logic (using standard ADK features) that runs *before* its primary observable task. This logic checks the outcome of Agent A. If Agent A failed, Agent B's primary task (e.g., logging a distinct "Agent B running" message) must be skipped. Agent B should record its outcome (e.g., skipped or completed).
    * **Agent C:** Designed with logic (using standard ADK features) that runs *before* its primary observable task. This logic checks the outcome of Agent B. If Agent B failed or was skipped, Agent C's primary task (e.g., logging a distinct "Agent C running" message) must be skipped. Agent C should record its outcome.
    * **Agent D:** Designed *without* the conditional skipping logic. Its primary task must always execute. This task involves accessing the recorded outcomes of Agents A, B, and C, generating a textual summary of the sequence execution (e.g., "A failed, B skipped, C skipped, D completed"), and recording/logging this summary. Agent D must ensure its execution completes in a way that allows the `SequentialAgent` to finish and return control.

### 4.2. Experimental Procedure (When Step A Fails)

1.  The developer triggers the `Root Agent` via the `adk web` interface.
2.  Agent A executes its task, including the tool call, which returns a structured error (Failure). This failure is observable via standard ADK logs/state.
3.  The conditional logic associated with Agent B executes, detects Agent A's failure, and prevents Agent B's primary task from running. This skipping is observable (e.g., lack of "Agent B running" log, state indicating skipped).
4.  The conditional logic associated with Agent C executes, detects Agent B's outcome (skipped/failed), and prevents Agent C's primary task from running. This skipping is observable.
5.  Agent D executes its primary task. This execution is observable (e.g., "Agent D running" log).
6.  Agent D generates and records/logs the execution summary (e.g., "A failed, B skipped, C skipped, D completed"). This summary is observable.
7.  Agent D completes, causing the `SequentialAgent` to finish. Control explicitly returns to the `Root Agent`.
8.  The `Root Agent` executes a final action indicating the sequence is complete (e.g., logging "Root Agent: Sequence complete, ready for next test"). This signal is observable.

## 5. Verification Criteria (Observable Outcomes)

The experiment is considered successful if, when run with Step A configured to fail, **all** of the following conditions are met, as observed through standard `adk web` logs and state inspection:

* **VC-1:** The distinct primary task of Agent B (e.g., its specific log message) is **not** observed.
* **VC-2:** The distinct primary task of Agent C (e.g., its specific log message) is **not** observed.
* **VC-3:** The distinct primary task of Agent D (e.g., its specific log message) **is** observed.
* **VC-4:** Agent D logs or records a summary message accurately reflecting the execution flow (e.g., stating that A failed, B and C were skipped, and D completed).
* **VC-5:** The `Root Agent` logs or signals that it regained control and the sequence completed *after* Step D finished its execution.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Standard ADK Features:** The mechanism implemented for conditional skipping (before B and C) and guaranteed finalization (Step D execution and control return) must primarily rely on standard, documented features and patterns of the Google ADK framework.

## 7. Constraints

* **Platform:** Must be implemented using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).
* **Core Component:** Must utilize the `SequentialAgent` component.
* **Failure Method:** The failure in Agent A must be simulated via a tool call that returns a structured error interpretable by the conditional logic.

## 8. Data Requirements (Level 1)

* **Input:** Trigger event from the developer via `adk web`. Internal configuration defining the agent sequence and Step A's failure behavior.
* **Key Observable Outputs:**
    * Logs and state changes visible in `adk web` indicating execution or skipping of primary tasks for agents A, B, C, D.
    * The summary string generated/logged by Agent D.
    * The completion signal logged by the `Root Agent`.
    * (Implicit) Internal state passed between steps reflecting outcomes, enabling Step D's summary.
