To precisely determine and experimentally validate how specific ADK features (like callbacks or escalation flags) can be used within a SequentialAgent to stop further processing after a step fails, yet still reliably execute a designated concluding step. This experiment aims to clarify the correct mechanism for achieving conditional intermediate step halting combined with guaranteed finalization within an ADK sequence.
