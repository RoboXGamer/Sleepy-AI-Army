### Update change_notes.md file
- IMPORTANT: Always preserve existing content and append new changes. Convey this very clearly to any sub task along with all of the important notes below
- First READ the current content of {{ generated_folder }}/generated/change_notes.md to determine the next version number
- Add a new section with:
  - Version title (increment from last version, e.g., if last was v03, use v04)
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT:
      - ONLY append new changes, DO NOT modify or delete existing content
      - ONLY include changes that have ALREADY been implemented, not future plans
      - Each new version should be added at the bottom of the file
      - Keep the same format as previous versions
      - When creating subtask for boomerang mode - only include the text that needs to change, don't include the entire change notes in the subtask prompt
