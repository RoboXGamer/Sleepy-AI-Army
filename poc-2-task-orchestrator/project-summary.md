This second Proof-of-Concept (PoC2) for the "Sleepy Dev Team" project focuses on validating the task intake and initial setup workflow using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). Launched via adk web, a root SingleTaskOrchestrator agent receives user chat input and determines if it describes a new task or references an existing one based on the input's format. If the input refers to an existing task, the orchestrator simply notifies the user; otherwise, it delegates the new task description to the TaskSetupAgent sub-agent. The TaskSetupAgent then uses an LLM to infer a task type prefix (like Bug_ or Feature_), calculates the next sequence number for that type by scanning existing folders, generates a concise slug, and automatically creates the standardized task folder structure (/ai-tasks/Prefix_NNN_slug/) with initial files. Successful completion demonstrates the system's ability to correctly route incoming task requests and automate the creation of organized workspaces for new development items.
