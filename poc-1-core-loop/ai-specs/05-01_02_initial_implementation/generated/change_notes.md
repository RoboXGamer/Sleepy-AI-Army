# Change Notes: Sleepy Dev Team - Core Loop PoC

## v01

**Description:** Initial implementation of the Core Loop PoC based on PRD PoC-1.0 and technical details.

**Details:**
*   Created project structure following ADK best practices and `tech-details.md`.
*   Implemented root `LoopAgent` (`src/sleepy_dev_poc/agent.py`).
*   Implemented `BacklogReaderAgent` (`src/sleepy_dev_poc/sub_agents/backlog_reader/agent.py`) using `LlmAgent`.
*   Implemented `process_backlog_file` `FunctionTool` (`src/sleepy_dev_poc/sub_agents/backlog_reader/tools.py`) to read/modify `ai-tasks/backlog.md` and handle escalation via `ToolContext`.
*   Added instruction prompt for `BacklogReaderAgent` (`src/sleepy_dev_poc/sub_agents/backlog_reader/prompt.py`).
*   Configured shared constants (`src/sleepy_dev_poc/shared_libraries/constants.py`).
*   Created `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, and a sample `ai-tasks/backlog.md`.
*   Added optional `main.py` runner script (`src/sleepy_dev_poc/main.py`).
*   Ensured necessary `__init__.py` files are present.

## v02

**Description:** Reviewed initial implementation against PRD and technical details.

**Details:**
*   Verified that the core agent structure (`LoopAgent` containing `BacklogReaderAgent`) matches requirements.
*   Confirmed the `BacklogReaderAgent` uses an `LlmAgent` and the specified `FunctionTool`.
*   Checked that the `process_backlog_file` tool implements the required file read/write logic for `ai-tasks/backlog.md`.
*   Validated the use of `ToolContext` and `actions.escalate` for loop termination signaling based on backlog state (empty/error).
*   Ensured the agent prompt aligns with the required output format based on tool status.
*   Confirmed project structure, constants, and setup files (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`) are correctly implemented.
*   Verified inclusion of logging and the optional `main.py` runner.
*   Confirmed that all created Python files include a trailing newline. The `process_backlog_file` tool also ensures `backlog.md` has a trailing newline if not empty after modification.
