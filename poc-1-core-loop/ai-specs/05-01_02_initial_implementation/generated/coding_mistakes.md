# Coding Mistakes Analysis: Feature 05-01_02_initial_implementation

This document summarizes coding mistakes and deviations from best practices identified during the review of commits for the initial implementation feature.

## Commit Analysis

### Commit: e3315c7 (Update prompt to follow best practices)
*   **File:** `src/sleepy_dev_poc/sub_agents/backlog_reader/prompt.py`
    *   **Issue:** Missing newline at the end of the file. (Violation of project rule: "Ensure there's a newline at the end of each file")

### Commit: 28c995c (Update backlog reader tool to use absolute path)
*   **File:** `src/sleepy_dev_poc/shared_libraries/constants.py`
    *   **Issue:** Hardcoded absolute Windows path for `BACKLOG_FILE_PATH`. This reduces portability and maintainability. Paths should ideally be constructed dynamically relative to the project root or configured externally.
    *   **Issue:** Missing newline at the end of the file. (Violation of project rule)
*   **File:** `src/sleepy_dev_poc/sub_agents/backlog_reader/tools.py`
    *   **Issue:** Missing newline at the end of the file. (Violation of project rule)

### Commit: 9a6d58f (Remove main.py)
*   **File:** `src/sleepy_dev_poc/main.py` (Deleted)
    *   **Issue (Historical):** The deleted file was missing a newline at the end. (Violation of project rule)

## Summary of Findings

*   **Consistent Missing Newlines:** Multiple Python files (`prompt.py`, `constants.py`, `tools.py`, deleted `main.py`) were missing the required trailing newline. This indicates a potential lack of automated checks or developer oversight regarding project standards.
*   **Hardcoded Absolute Path:** Using a hardcoded absolute path in `constants.py` is a significant maintainability and portability issue. Configuration or dynamic path construction should be preferred.
