This project is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) designed to validate the core agent looping and file interaction mechanisms for the larger "Sleepy Dev Team" initiative using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). It implements a minimal ADK application featuring a LoopAgent that iteratively invokes a BacklogReaderAgent. The BacklogReaderAgent utilizes ADK tools to read task descriptions one by one from a designated /ai-tasks/backlog.md file, report the task content, and then physically remove the processed line from the file. Execution relies on the standard adk web command within a local Python virtual environment, with progress observed via console output. Successful completion will demonstrate the fundamental ADK patterns for sequential task processing from a file and tool-based file system interaction, confirming feasibility for the main project.
